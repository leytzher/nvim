# Neovim configuration :rocket:

This is my personal Neovim configuration.

It is heavily based on Sami's configuration (https://github.com/SamiAlsubhi/nvim.git)

### Requirements
- Neovim > 0.5.0


### Installation
Just clone this repo in your ~/.config directory and start Neovim
```
cd ~/.config/
git clone https://github.com/leytzher/nvim.git
```
